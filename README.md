# mentor-swipe

## Inspiration

Things are often confusing. Especially for students who have to experience many new things like jobs, new schools, and much more, having a mentor can help guide them along the way. As I enter university soon there are many things I have no clue about and having a mentor along the way would be something everyone would benefit from.

## What it does

Through a swiping motion similar to TikTok, you swipe through mentors of your interest. When there is one that you find is the perfect match, you can swipe right to message them. It aims to pair every student with their matching mentor.

## How we built it

I built it using React Native and Firebase. I had to learn basically everything, since they were both things I had never touched before in my life. Though many Stack Overflow articles and YouTube videos later, I was able to create something ~~mid~~.

## Challenges we ran into

The whole thing was a challenge to be honest. I was clueless about everything, which is where a mentor would have come along great. However, with mentor swipe not yet created, that did not happen. Thus, I had to learn everything myself and scourer articles and videos. 

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

I am pretty happy I was able to put something out, whether it is good or not.

## What we learned

I learned a lot of things, mainly pertaining to React Native and Firebase. I also improved my front-end and back-end skills.

## What's next for Mentor Swipe

There is a lot of opportunity with mentor swipe. First, adding more interest categories to improve the breadth of the students that can be reached. Second, actually getting more mentors on the platform varying over the interests. Finally, adding more features and smoothing out the website in general.
